    "text": "What’s special about the auditory system?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaas & Hackett (2000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVan Essen et al. (1992)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why should we focus on the subcortical parts of the auditory system? I said that those are the harder parts to investigate with MRI, right? Well, there’s actually a lot going on in the brainstem and thalamus, especially in the auditory system. Two examples from primates show differences between the wiring of the auditory and visual systems. In the auditory system, the first 5 layers of the system are subcortical, and with some cross-talk between them, so some processing can pass through even more structures. Meanwhile, in the visual system, there’s just one or two stages before hitting primary sensory cortex. Indeed, a lot of processing is already done by the retina itself. With other features extracted later in successively higher levels of visual cortex. Whereas in the auditory system, there’s some basic frequency and sound level information pulled out by the cochlea, but some other features like location of sound sources are extracted in the brainstem.\nBUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR KNOWLEDGE COMES FROM ANIMAL STUDIES"

The experimental paradigm followed a rapid-eventrelated design in which sounds were presented with a mean inter stimulus interval of four volumes (minimum three maximum five volumes). The two sessions were identical and each session consisted of twelve functional runs and across the 12 runs each sound was presented three times (i.e. each sounds was presented six times across the two sessions). The 168 sounds were divided in four sets of 42 sounds, each set was presented in three (non consecutive) runs. As a result, the 12 functional runs of each session formed four cross validation sets each one consisting of nine training runs and three testing runs (i.e. 126 training and 42 testing sounds). Note that the testing runs were non overlapping across the cross validations. Catch trials (i.e. sound repetitions) were added to each run, and were excluded from all analyses.\n\n\nSitek and Gulban et al. (2019 eLife)"
